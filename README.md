## Notes
This notebook is intended to provide an analytical notebook for use with other geochemical analysis projects. 

**⚠️ Note on Dash usage**

This notebook uses `jupyter_dash` to enable Dash interactivity
inside Binder/Jupyter environments.
While `jupyter_dash` is officially deprecated, it remains the only
reliable way to run Dash-based interactive visualizations inline
in Binder as of 2026.
This choice is intentional for archival reproducibility.
