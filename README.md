## Notes
This notebook is intended to provide an analytical notebook for exploring Anillo Obsidian geochemistry and it can be repurposed for use with other geochemical analysis datasets.
Proceed through the Jupyter Notebook by clicking in the first cell then press Shift-Return to advance through the notebook.
The map and the plots are interactive.

**⚠️ Note on Dash usage**

This notebook uses `jupyter_dash` to enable Dash interactivity
inside Binder/Jupyter environments.
While `jupyter_dash` is officially deprecated, it remains the only
reliable way to run Dash-based interactive visualizations inline
in Binder as of 2026.
This choice is intentional for archival reproducibility.
